// DarkSky tmTheme

A [E Text Editor][1]/[TextMate][2]/[Sublime Text][3] theme whichs is easy on the eyes, and provides enjoyable code auditing.

___NOTE___: This theme has only been tested with the Windows equivalents of the code editors ([E][1] and [Sublime][3]), but should work with [TextMate][2] as well.
